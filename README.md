This C++ program showcases the implementation of a Date class that enables users to input and compare dates. The class offers functionalities to set, display, and compare dates, along with checking for leap years. The code defines a Date class with private attributes for month, day, and year. It includes constructors for initialization and methods for setting dates, displaying dates, and checking leap years.

The class also overloads operators for equality (==) and output (<<), allowing for intuitive comparison and printing of Date objects. Additionally, an input operator (>>) is overloaded to enable user-friendly input of dates in the format (dd/mm/yyyy).

In the main function, two instances of the Date class are created, and the user is prompted to input two dates. The program then displays the entered dates and compares them using the overloaded equality operator. If the dates are equal, it indicates so; otherwise, it displays that the dates are not equal.

This code demonstrates object-oriented programming principles in C++ by implementing a versatile Date class and showcasing operator overloading for enhanced functionality and user interaction.
